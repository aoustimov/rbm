RBM work

This is a collection of code built for unsupervised representation learning for categorical data. It casts the Restricted Boltzmann Machine in a TensorFlow Keras
framework, which allows us to use the Keras.Tuner for tuning model hyperparameters.

Functional now, but still a work in progress.
